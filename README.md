# Etch-A-Sketch

This project will demand the following from the author:
- A mix of HTML, CSS and JS
- DOM Elements 
- The JS part will be specially demanding in terms of using the basic
  functionality of control-flow, loops and arrays.
- As the first project in TOP that does not hold your hand, 
  it is expected to google a lot for certain parts of the programs
  functionality. Don't create the wheel.
- Still, it is allowed to google smaller parts, NOT THE COMPLETE SOLUTION!
- Remember to use pseudo-code to understand a difficult problem
  and have fun! It is just an experiment :)
